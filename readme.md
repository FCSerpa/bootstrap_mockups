#Bootstrap Mockups

A lab for [Front-end Productivity w/ Bootstrap & Bower]() lesson.

##Goal

Use Bootstrap's library to help you impliment mockups!

##Setup

* Work in pairs!
* Use bower to include jQuery and Bootstrap (the CSS, JS, and theme files).
* For each mockup in the `mockups` directory create a seperate html file and require your libraries in it.


##Tips

* Refer to the Bootstrap's documention for more guidance. You can find two main sectinons of documentation, one for all of Bootstraps [CSS classes](http://getbootstrap.com/css/), and another for all of it's [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) (a combination of CSS & JavaScript)
* For placeholder images you try [placekitten](https://placekitten.com/)!
